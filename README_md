Installation
--------------------------
You can install My Project Name via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

```bash
npm install @my-npm-scope/my-package-name
```



Usage
--------------------------
When using My Project Name in Node.js apps, you'll probably want to use **CommonJS** syntax:

```javascript
const myLibrary = require("@my-npm-scope/my-package-name");
```

When using a transpiler such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), or a bundler such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), you can use **ECMAScript modules** syntax instead:

```javascript
import myLibrary from "@my-npm-scope/my-package-name";
```



Browser support
--------------------------
My Project Name supports recent versions of every major web browser.  Older browsers may require [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and/or [polyfills](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill).

To use My Project Name in a browser, you'll need to use a bundling tool such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). Some bundlers may require a bit of configuration, such as setting `browser: true` in [rollup-plugin-resolve](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-node-resolve).
